When submitting your assignment, include answers to the following.

## Identify the component of this assignment that you did the best on, and why.
I think i did best on my switch statement. I had to redo it a few times but eventually got it to work. 

## Describe in plain english what problem this assignment was posing, and what your solution was to it.
The problem this assignment posed was calculate the scoring stats for different players in a fantasy football games. Depending on the players position, their stats differed and needed to calculate different stats. 

## What was your approach or process?
My approach was to read the readme file many times because I didnâ€™t understand the jargon all that much. Initially I wrote a different type of switch statement and I thought I needed to add more functions and declare variables. So my tests were not able to run. I read the readme again and then I understood all I had to was put the objects inside the the return statement and it was easier to understand. 

## What were your challenges?
My biggest problems were creating the switch statement and creating the objects. I had to understand how objects worked inside a function. 

## What resources did you use?
I used the powerpoint slides from this week, w3schools and MDN mozilla website.
